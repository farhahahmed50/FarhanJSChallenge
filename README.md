The user can choose whether to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numeric characters, and/or special characters. The user can also choose the password length between 8 and 128 characters using a range slider. The chosen password length is being displayed to the user. Once all choices are made, the user clicks "Generate password" and the generated password is being displayed.

The user has to at least choose one of the four character options as this is required to generate a password. The user input is validated. If none of the options are chosen and the user clicks "Generate password", an error message is displayed notifying the user that they have to make a choice.
